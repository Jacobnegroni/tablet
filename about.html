        <p>
        I’m a Junior at the University of Michigan studying design and data analytics in the School of Information where I focus on the intersection of people, information, and technology. I have been passionate about developing ideas since I was a kid, always jotting them down in a notebook. Because of these ideas, I've come with a unique set of experiences as I have founded and ran several small businesses, some very successful, some not as much, but in each one of those businesses, I have taken what I have learned and applied it to the next venture.<br>
        <br>
        I hope to use my technical, creative, and strategic skills to develop tangible solutions and that will help organizations best accomplish their goals. Over the summer, I was presented with a problem, pitched a potential solution to the CEO of the client, Ideanomics, and the team decided to implement that idea, giving me the ability to fully manage the entire project.<br>
        <br>
        I believe the success of this revolutionary database was because of the team-oriented environment I was a part of, combined with my extremely unique mindset - where when I am presented with a problem, I analyze and pick it apart from all different angles, often recognizing patterns that most do not. I am looking for an internship opportunity that allows me to thrive in a team oriented enviornment and develop essential skills.  <br>
